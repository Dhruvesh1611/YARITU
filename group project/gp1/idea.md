*Goal*: Create an all-in-one platform to enhance student life by providing essential tools and services in one place. The Campus Hub will help students manage academic, social, and campus-related activities seamlessly, offering features such as:

•⁠  ⁠*A Marketplace* for buying, selling, and trading secondhand goods (textbooks, electronics, furniture).
•⁠  ⁠*A Study Group Platform* to connect students for academic collaboration and course-related discussions.
•⁠  ⁠*An Interactive Campus Map* to help students navigate the campus and find key facilities.

The goal is to provide a cohesive, user-friendly platform that simplifies daily routines and keeps students connected to the campus community.

## UI/UX Design Solutions

### Modular Design
Treat the platform as *modules* (Marketplace, Study Groups, Map), allowing each feature to maintain its own design while still contributing to a unified experience.

### Navigation Focus
Use a *Bottom Navigation Bar* or *Sidebar* for easy access to different sections. The dashboard could display relevant updates like upcoming study sessions or new marketplace listings.

### Clear Onboarding & User Flows
•⁠  ⁠*Onboarding screens* to guide new users.
•⁠  ⁠Personalize the homepage for returning users with recently used features or activities.

### Design Consistency
Maintain a *single design language* across all features to ensure a cohesive look, even if the features differ (e.g., a map, chat interface, marketplace).

### Feature Segmentation
Present relevant content based on user context (marketplace, study groups, or map). Use *tabs, **modals, or **dynamic sections* to avoid overwhelming users.

### Responsive Design
Ensure the platform is *fully responsive* for both desktop and mobile devices. Mobile-first design is essential, especially for features like the marketplace.

### Gradual Rollout
•⁠  ⁠Focus on one core feature first (e.g., Marketplace).
•⁠  ⁠Gather feedback and improve iteratively before adding more features like Study Groups and Campus Map.
