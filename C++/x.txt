Key Features of a Production Build:
Minification:

Removes unnecessary characters like spaces, comments, and line breaks from the code to reduce file size.
Bundling:

Combines all your appâ€™s files into one or a few files to reduce the number of HTTP requests.
Tree Shaking:

Removes unused or dead code from your app to make it smaller and faster.
Compression:

Files are often compressed (e.g., Gzip or Brotli) to further reduce size and improve load times.
Environment-Specific Code:

Removes development-only features, like detailed error messages or debugging tools, to improve performance and security.
Browser Compatibility:

Transpiles modern JavaScript (e.g., ES6+) into a version that works in older browsers if needed.
Why is a Production Build Important?
Faster Load Times: Optimized files load quickly for users.
Better Performance: Smaller code means faster execution in the browser.
Security: Removes sensitive development information.
Professional Deployment: Ensures that the app is ready for real-world use.
